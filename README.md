## JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator

## Challenges

The Challenges in this module was to have a button to randomly generate a password, by using for loops, conditional and if statements. The user would also get a prompt to make sure they are meeting the criteria of their selection. User will need to select a number between 8 to 128 it cannot be less than 8 or moe than 128 and answer the following confirm prompt to generate a password.

## Lessons Learned

Lesson I have learned is to create array of variable, for loops, if statement and prompts. Overall this assignment basically gave me an insight of how logical you have to be and there so much variable being delcared that sort makes everything so confusing.
